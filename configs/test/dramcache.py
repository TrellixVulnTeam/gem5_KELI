""" This file creates a single CPU and a two-level cache system.
This script takes a single parameter which specifies a binary to execute.
If none is provided it executes 'hello' by default (mostly used for testing)

See Part 1, Chapter 3: Adding cache to the configuration script in the
learning_gem5 book for more information about this script.
This file exports options for the L1 I/D and L2 cache sizes.

IMPORTANT: If you modify this file, it's likely that the Learning gem5 book
           also needs to be updated. For now, email Jason <power.jg@gmail.com>
